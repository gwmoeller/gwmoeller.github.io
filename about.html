			<h3 class="treasury-header-cust">Introductions</h3>
			<p>My name is pROBOTafessor, and I am your group leader.  I used to be a feeder, living with unimaginable stress every START, BEGIN, FIGHT, ..etc. My friends would yell at me, and my family would look the other way. However, that mess is in the past.</p>

			<p>I am now 7 months sober and I now successfully game. Games, although stressful, create a fulfilling experience for me, and are now feed-less. What all of you need to understand is that a death is not feeding, and it is okay to ruin your kda when it is for the team's benefit. However, there is a fine line in sacrifice, and creating a monster. This concept is something you all should be aware of with respect to your individual time.</p>

			<p>Now I serve my calling to groups like this one where all of you can share your experiences and games successfully. This poison, is a very slippery slope, and of course slip-ups will occur. What is important is that you fix  yourself at your own pace, and realize.... </p>

			<p>... its okay to let your teammate die, if you joining in to save them will have no real effect.</p>
			<p>... its never okay to let me die. <<------ (very important)</p>

			<p>Your growth will be difficult, and although you may want to give in to your feeding ways, I know that you are able to remove your weaker selves. I guarantee that you all will climb and leave your feeding life-style behind. I will always put my faith and trust in the system I am now a part of to help others.</p>

			<p>"Although my life is but a finite life-span within a finite world, controlled by a finite being, within a theoretically infinite world, I will not feed.... so as to not create otherworldly monsters for my team to contend with. --"</p>

					<h3 class="treasury-header-cust">History</h3>
					<p>FEED started out as a tiny guild. Although, depending when you are reading this we might still be a tiny guild. We are casual gamers that try stupid things and sometimes it works out.</p>

					<p>Our Guild was built by five family members. pROBOTafessor, Swoeller, JradRun, Zethius, and TankTread built the guild from the ground up. We though about maybe trying to recruit but when put to a decision it was too much of a bother.</p>

					<p>We like the freedom of running around at our own whim, accountable to none and no responsibilities to worry about.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<h3 class="treasury-header-cust">Future</h3>
					<p>We hope those that join our ranks will take pleasure in an already established guild hall. We also wish that we can grow and nurture each other as effective group members and leaders.</p>

					<p>Feed wants to pursue larger scale events like raids, gvg, wvw zergs, fractals and meta events. Being able to single handedly compete in these events would create a whole new atmosphere and entertainment for FEED.</p>
					<p>I, pROBOTafessor, hope you enjoy your time in FEED.</p>
