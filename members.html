								<p>My name is pROBOTafessor, and I am your group leader.  I used to be a feeder, living with unimaginable stress every START, BEGIN, FIGHT, ..etc. My friends would yell at me, and my family would look the other way. However, that mess is in the past.</p>

								<p>I am now 7 months sober and I now successfully game. Games, although stressful, create a fulfilling experience for me, and are now feed-less. What all of you need to understand is that a death is not feeding, and it is okay to ruin your kda when it is for the team's benefit. However, there is a fine line in sacrifice, and creating a monster. This concept is something you all should be aware of with respect to your individual time.</p>

								<p>Now I serve my calling to groups like this one where all of you can share your experiences and games successfully. This poison, is a very slippery slope, and of course slip-ups will occur. What is important is that you fix  yourself at your own pace, and realize....</p>

								<p>... its okay to let your teammate die, if you joining in to save them will have no real effect.</p>
								<p>... its never okay to let me die. <<------ (very important)</p>

								<p>Your growth will be difficult, and although you may want to give in to your feeding ways, I know that you are able to remove your weaker selves. I guarantee that you all will climb and leave your feeding life-style behind. I will always put my faith and trust in the system I am now a part of to help others.</p>

								<p>Hello, I am JRadRun, or sometimes known as Syr Clawtorch, or my other widely, popular name -- Feeder. I know I haven't said much, but you've seen me in game and  I've taken my time to post. I just wanted to be comfortable with the group and myself before I openly admit that I too... am a Feeder. I didn't believe it and it's taken me time, but the fact is... and  it's a hard fact to swallow.  I -- holds back tears -- I just don't know how to be... better. I want to be better.</p>

								<p>breaks down cryin</p>

								<p>I can't stand feeding and being called out on it.  My foes insult me at every turn. Thanking me for my feeding; adding to their gluttony, while my teammates add insult to injury by chanting "Feeder, Feeder, shouldn't be a Breather".... It's agonizing.</p>

								<p>I want help. I NEED help...  and I've come here for support and hope I can improve with you all on my adventures and maybe... just maybe. End the feeding.</p>

								<p>Hello, my name is AFKden, or Zethius, depending on how my games are going. I tend to get upset with teammates doing obvious misplays or constant trolling. But perhaps the thing that tilts me most in games is when I don't do enough for the team or enough to carry, no matter how my teammates are doing.</p>
