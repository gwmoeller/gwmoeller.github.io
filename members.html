					<h5>pROBOTafessor...</h5>
					<p>My name is pROBOTafessor, and I am your group leader.  I used to be a feeder, living with unimaginable stress every START, BEGIN, FIGHT, ..etc. My friends would yell at me, and my family would look the other way. However, that mess is in the past.</p> 

					<p>I am now 7 months sober and I now successfully game. Games, although stressful, create a fulfilling experience for me, and are now feed-less. What all of you need to understand is that a death is not feeding, and it is okay to ruin your kda when it is for the team's benefit. However, there is a fine line in sacrifice, and creating a monster. This concept is something you all should be aware of with respect to your individual time.</p>

					<p>Now I serve my calling to groups like this one where all of you can share your experiences and games successfully. This poison, is a very slippery slope, and of course slip-ups will occur. What is important is that you fix  yourself at your own pace, and realize....</p>

					<ul>
						<li>... its okay to sit under turret until the 30 minute mark.</li>
						<li>... its okay to let your teammate die, if you joining in to save them will have no real effect.</li>
						<li>... its okay to triage a top-laner if their contributions will be dissappointing</li>
						<li>... its never okay to let me die. <<------ (very important)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Your growth will be difficult, and although you may want to give in to your feeding ways, I know that you are able to remove your weaker selves. I guarantee that you all will climb and leave your feeding life-style behind. I will always put my faith and trust in the system I am now a part of to help others.</p>

					<h5>Swoeller...</h5>
					<p>My name is Swoeller. I have found success in most of my games lately. Though I still have tendencies to feed when trying new things and have habits of trying to help my team when the situation is already lost.</p>

				<div class="container container-cust">
					<h5>JradRun...</h5>
					<p>Hello, I am JRadRun, or sometimes known as Crihn, or my other widely, popular name -- Feeder. I know I haven't said much, but you've seen me in game and  I've taken my time to post. I just wanted to be comfortable with the group and myself before I openly admit that I too... am a Feeder. I didn't believe it and it's taken me time, but the fact is... and  it's a hard fact to swallow.  I -- holds back tears -- I just don't know how to be... better. I want to be better.</p>

					<p>(breaks down crying)</p>

					<p>I can't stand feeding and being called out on it.  My foes insult me at every turn. Thanking me for my feeding; adding to their gluttony, while my teammates add insult to injury by chanting "Feeder, Feeder, shouldn't be a Breather".... It's agonizing.</p>

					<p>I want help. I NEED help...  and I've come here for support and hope I can improve with you all on my adventures and maybe... just maybe. End the feeding.</p>

					<p>(wipes away tear with a twinkle of hope shining through my eyes)</p>

					<h5>AFKaden...</h5>
					<p>Hello, my name is AFKaden, or Zethius, depending on how my games are going. I tend to get upset with teammates doing obvious misplays or constant trolling. But perhaps the thing that tilts me most in games is when I don't do enough for the team or enough to carry, no matter how my teammates are doing.</p>

					<p>So shall we begin the process after so long?</p>
